Good algorithm, I like the use of padding the denominator with zeros to make the division work.  The algorithm does not 
account for when the denominator is bigger than the numerator, but the algorithm still works by default by returning zero.
A full algorithm description in the method header would be helpful, but it is otherwise well commented.  The code appears 
very reusable and looks like it would work for any huge_number value.

The division algorithm was not quite finished, but the intended method made sense and was on the right track.  There were
a few small errors that appeared to cause a problem -- Jeff intended to use the same padding method as Jonathan did, but was
also padding the numerator which appeared to cause a problem.  Also, challenges seemed to arise when storing the huge_numbers 
in an int character, which could have been possibly avoided using the subtraction method of division.  The code was not in a helper
method, which may have helped with code reusability and organization, but otherwise the program was well commented and made sense as 
a work in progress.

One improvement would be to add comments to the header (.h) file in order for users to get an idea of how the algorithm works.  Otherwise
my algorithm apparently looked pretty good. Although it is maybe a little confusing because it uses a number of helper methods (add, subtract, etc)
within the division algorithm, but overall I was told the code looks pretty concise and efficient and looks like it should work for any huge_number.
