The tests appear complete and are well organized
into blocks. They are well commented so they are 
easy to understand. There are a sufficient number 
of stress tests that test all the basic functionality
of the wordset class.  There may be a few more edge
cases that could have been tested but overall it looks 
good.  The code appears sustainable, and tests are not
dependent on eachother. The tests can be easily duplicated
and changed.

The tests seem quite robust and like they cover all the
statements in the student's wordset function.  The test 
appear complete and are easily understandable.  The tests
are well documented, but could use a bit more commenting 
and larger header comments for clarity.  There is also some
test dependency, because all the tests use the same wordset
so if one test does not pass, the following test will likely
fail. One alternative to this would be to use more blocks to
segment the code and use new wordsets for each block. Otherwise
the tests look good and very reusable.

The tests appear complete and are well organized
into blocks. They are well commented so they are 
easy to understand.  They appear to cover all the 
statements so code coverage looks good, but I could
have possibly done more stress tests with large data
sets or small initial wordset tables. The code looks 
sustainable and tests are not dependent on eachother. 
The only dependency is a boolean that indicates if the
tests have collectively pass or fail, so I maybe should
have printed out pass, fail values individually.
